## 🎮 How to Play

> **1.** Enter your name → avatar auto-generates  
> **2.** Create a room or join with a 6-letter room code  
> **3.** Host configures settings and starts the game  
> **4.** One player draws — others type guesses in chat  
> **5.** Faster correct guess = more points. Most points wins! 🏆

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
React (UI + Canvas)
      ↕ Socket.IO (WebSocket)
Node.js + Express (Game Logic)
      ↕
  SQLite + words.json
```

### OOP Backend Structure

```
📦 server/classes/
├── 👤 Player.js       — id, name, score, avatar, state flags

├── 🏠 Room.js         — players, spectators, settings, phase, moderation
└── 📨 MessageHandler.js — routes all Socket.IO events to Room/Game methods
```

### Game State Machine

```
LOBBY → WORD_SELECTION → DRAWING → ROUND_END → (loop or GAME_OVER)
```

## 🧑‍💻 Code Walkthrough

**How drawing sync works:**
Canvas mouse events → `draw_start/move/end` emitted → server records stroke in `game.strokeHistory` → broadcasts `draw_data` to all clients → viewers render stroke on their canvas in real time.

**How game state is managed:**
Server is single source of truth. `Game` class owns rounds, turn order, timer (`setInterval`), hints, and scores. State changes are broadcast via `game_state` and phase-specific events.

**How guessing works:**
`guess.toLowerCase().trim() === currentWord.toLowerCase().trim()` — simple normalize + compare. Correct → points calculated by `Math.floor(100 * (timeRemaining / drawTime))`, minimum 10 pts.
